# Smart Hostel Utility Management System (SHUMS) - Project Statement

## Problem Statement
Hostel facilities consume significant amounts of electricity and water daily, but there is no structured monitoring in place. This lack of monitoring makes it difficult to identify wastage, abnormal consumption spikes, or inefficient usage patterns. Without timely insights, hostel management cannot optimize resource consumption effectively.

## Scope of the Project
The project aims to build a Python-based system to record, store, analyze, and visualize daily electricity and water consumption data for different hostel blocks. It will support data input, generate summary reports over different time frames, detect abnormal consumption spikes, and provide basic visualizations to aid decision-making. Data will be stored in CSV files for easy management.

## Target Users
- Hostel wardens and administrative staff responsible for facility management.
- Maintenance teams interested in monitoring resource usage patterns.
- Institution management seeking insights for resource optimization.

## High-Level Features
- Input module for entering daily electricity and water usage by block.
- Persistent storage of usage data in CSV format.
- Analytics module providing daily, weekly, and monthly summaries.
- Alert system to detect and report abnormal spikes in utility consumption using moving average analytics.
- Optional visualization of consumption trends and block-wise comparisons via charts.
- Command-line interface providing a user-friendly, menu-driven interaction.
